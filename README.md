# ETC5550: Assignment 3

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 3 of the ETC5550 unit (Applied Forecasting).

The assignment involves using national population data from 1960-2022 to fit an ETS model and three benchmark methods to training data, and evaluating their forecast accuracy on a test set from 2018-2022 based on RMSE. Additionally, the assignment includes checking the residuals from the best model using an ACF plot and a Ljung-Box test, and performing time-series cross-validation with a minimum sample size of 15 years, a step size of 1 year, and a forecast horizon of 5 years. The goal is to compare the reliability of these two methods of evaluating accuracy.
